# react-native-expo-auth
## React native expo auth boilerplate


Template for react-native projects in need of firebase related authentication. 

This is the second iteration of a project I started 2 years ago ( https://github.com/jorge-cob/react-native-expo-auth ) which has its own repository due to the significant changes in the project's structure and libraries that are to be used.


## Features

- Sign in or sign up into your app using email and password or Google sign in (other firebase supported authentication methods may be implemented) and navigate between screens.

## Tech

Cloud Task Manager uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [React Native] (https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/) 
- [Typescript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Storage and database management.
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) - State container.
